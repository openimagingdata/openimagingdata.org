# Open Radiology Data Model

The Open Radiology Data Model (ORDM) project seeks to define a common programming interface in multiple programming languages (at least TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and C#) for accessing and manipulating the data associated with clinical radiology exams. The model is centered around radiology reports, which describe imaging findings, diagnoses, and recommendations.
