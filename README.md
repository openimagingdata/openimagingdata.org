# Open Radiology Data Model

The Open Radiology Data Model (ORDM) project seeks to define common structures representing the data associated with clinical radiology exams. The model is centered around radiology reports, which describe imaging findings, diagnoses, and recommendations. These standard structures are labeled semantically according to standard Common Data Element (CDE) tags from the RSNA/ACR's [RadElement](https://radelement.org) repository. To support standard methods of accessing and manipulating the data structure, the project aims to develop and maintain programming interfaces in multiple languages (at least TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and C#).
